    <p>Code editor
        Visual Studio (like any other IDE) includes a code editor that supports syntax highlighting and code completion
        using IntelliSense for variables, functions, methods, loops, and LINQ queries.[21] IntelliSense is supported for
        the included languages, as well as for XML, Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript when developing web sites and
        web applications.[22][23] Autocomplete suggestions appear in a modeless list box over the code editor window, in
        proximity of the editing cursor. In Visual Studio 2008 onwards, it can be made temporarily semi-transparent to
        see the code obstructed by it.[21] The code editor is used for all supported languages.

        The Visual Studio Code Editor also supports setting bookmarks in code for quick navigation. Other navigational
        aids include collapsing code blocks and incremental search, in addition to normal text search and regex
        search.[24] The code editor also includes a multi-item clipboard and a task list.[24] The code editor supports
        code snippets, which are saved templates for repetitive code and can be inserted into code and customized for
        the project being worked on. A management tool for code snippets is built in as well. These tools are surfaced
        as floating windows which can be set to automatically hide when unused or docked to the side of the screen. The
        Visual Studio code editor also supports code refactoring including parameter reordering, variable and method
        renaming, interface extraction, and encapsulation of class members inside properties, among others.

        Visual Studio features background compilation (also called incremental compilation).[25][26] As code is being
        written, Visual Studio compiles it in the background in order to provide feedback about syntax and compilation
        errors, which are flagged with a red wavy underline. Warnings are marked with a green underline. Background
        compilation does not generate executable code, since it requires a different compiler than the one used to
        generate executable code.[27] Background compilation was initially introduced with Microsoft Visual Basic, but
        has now been expanded for all included languages.[26]
